# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

## Task
In this challenge, the hypothetical client provided a brief that asked me to refactor code to make their webpage meet accessability standards.

### Without changing functionality, I was to:
  
  -Change generic html elements into semantic html elements
  -Reorganize elements for future readability
  -Ensure all images and icons have accessable alt attributes 
  -Add concise title to webpage
  


## Solved Issues
"Search Enginge Optimization" link broken. 

## Unsolved Issues
Some style elements did not match. Header, main, and aside had slightly different color shades. Unsure if intended style or not. 

Some styling elements break at width<1012px
