# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

## Task
In this challenge, the hypothetical client provided a brief that asked me to refactor code to make their webpage meet accessability standards.

### Without changing functionality, I was to:
  
  -Change generic html elements into semantic html elements
  -Reorganize elements for future readability
  -Ensure all images and icons have accessable alt attributes 
  -Add concise title to webpage

## Solved Issues
Changed generic div tags to elements like "figure, aside, footer", etc. 
Reorganized CSS page and added notes to identify groupings of style elements
Moved hero image from CSS file to HTML file 
Added alt text to images and icons
Added webpage title 
Fixed broken "Search Enginge Optimization" link. 

## Unsolved Issues
Some style elements did not match. Header, main, and aside had slightly different color shades. Unsure if intended style or not. 
Some styling elements break at width<1012px
